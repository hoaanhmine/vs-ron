			"text": "Hi, FNM server. I am VoidGuy, and I came here to look for help on my new mod. Presenting FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN: EXPANDED! This mod will feature 800 NEW WEEKS, featuring old and new characters, totalling up to 2400 SONGS! (Don't worry, l'll make those). We're also adding a brand new original mechanic for each new week, which means there's 800 MECHANICS in this one mod! That's crazy, right? We're also going to add a hub world, a mission system and 500+ ACHIEVEMENTS for you to collect, all on a brand new engine made specifically for the mod! Do you like how I talk? Do you like how I walk? Do you like how my face disintegrates into chalk?"
